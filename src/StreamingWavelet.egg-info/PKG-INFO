# Python implementation for _Streaming Wavelet Operator_

This is the python implementation for the Streaming Wavelet Operator, which **sequentially**
applies wavelet transform to a 1D signal efficiently in an online manner (instead of recalculation in each round).

The **speed** of the Streaming Wavelet Operator is much faster than the traditional wavelet transform,
especially for long signals, due to its use of lazy updates and bit-wise operations in the implementation.

We will first introduce the structure and requirements of the code, followed by a brief instruction for a quick start.

## Code Structure

- `src/StreamingWavelet.py`: The main file for the Streaming Wavelet Operator, which supports dozens of wavelet types.
- `src/MakeCDJVFilter.py`: The file for generating the filters of different wavelet transforms, thanks to the MatLab code of _Cohen, Daubechies, Jawerth and Vial, 1992_.
- `sec/wavelet_coeff`: The folder for storing the different wavelet coefficients.

## Requirements

* numpy==1.19.0

## Quick Start

We provide a concrete demo here.
For example, one can use the following code to generate the following Streaming Wavelet Operator
for a sequence of `dim=128`, `max_length=10000`, and using the Haar wavelets (`order=1`) as wavelet basis.

```python
import StreamingWavelet

SW = StreamingWavelet(128, 10000, 1)
```

Then, for a sequence of length 10000, one can use the following code to sequentially calculate the wavelet coefficients in an online manner:

```python
import numpy as np
import StreamingWavelet

SW = StreamingWavelet(128, 10000, 1)  # Initialize the Streaming Wavelet Operator

# Generate a sequence of length 10000
x_list = []
for i in range(10000):
    x_list.append(np.random.randn(128))  # Generate a random element of dim=128, and add it to the sequence

for i in range(10000):
    SW.add_signal(x_list[i])  # Update the wavelet coefficients by adding the new element
    current_norm = SW.get_norm()  # Get the norm of the wavelet coefficients
    print('Norm of Wavelet Coefficients of x_list[0:{}]:'.format(i), current_norm)  # Print the current norm of the wavelet coefficients
```

which will output the norm of the wavelet coefficients in each round.
